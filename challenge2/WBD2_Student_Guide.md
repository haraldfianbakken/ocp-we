### Customer situation

Contoso Group is a US-based telecommunications company with worldwide operations serving almost 150 million mobile subscribers. The company is looking to optimize its IT environment and considering moving some of its on-premises SAP workloads to Azure.

Contoso Group has an existing on-premises deployment of SAP ECC (SAP ERP Central Component) 6.0 on Windows Server 2012 R2 with a SQL Server 2014 database in its US-based data center near New York City. The deployment consists of the development, test, quality assurance, and production systems. However, the IT organization finds it challenging to expand the SAP landscape to accommodate growing number of SAP-related business requests. This is related to the time and resources required to move through development and testing phases and implement new business processes into production. In addition, IT finds it difficult to adjust the size of the production environment in order to accommodate varying level of workloads. IT is also concerned about lack of high availability and disaster recovery capabilities in the existing deployment. The estimates of providing such capabilities for production workloads exceed the budget allocated for this purpose by far.

As the result, agility of the organization is hampered by capital expenditures and the time necessary to acquire and provision project-related SAP development and testing environments. Representatives of central IT management, including the company CIO Andrew Cross and its VP of IT Operations are concerned about managing test/dev infrastructure costs. There are also concerns regarding aging data center and hardware. Business Development Manager (BDM) and the company CFO would like to lower TCO for the SAP landscape, including the production ECC environment.

**Current situation**

The production app tier consists of three physical servers, each with 8 CPU cores and 32GB RAM. The production database tier is hosted on a single physical server with the same hardware configuration. The average performance of the application tier and the database tier is about 30,000 SAPS and 15,000 SAPS, respectively. The production SAP database workload generates about 10,000 IOPS. The current production DB size is 750GB. According to the estimates of the Contoso SAP team, the database is bound to grow to about 1TB in the next few years. In case of a disaster affecting the production instance, the business expects the RPO and RTO of 15 minutes and 6 hours, respectively. The database transaction log backup should be performed very 15 minutes, with one full daily backup. Daily full backups must be retained for 1 month and monthly full backups for 1 year.

**Customer objectives**

As Andrew Cross, the company's CIO wants to significantly improve times it takes to provision development and test SAP environments. At the same time, he stresses the importance of minimizing their cost. He also points out the criticality of the SAP production workloads and the need of protecting them against unplanned downtime. As he stated, "The existing on-premises SAP development and test environments no longer meet the agility required by the fast pace of changes in our business. In addition, our operational dependencies on SAP applications force us to seek reasonably priced availability and disaster recovery capabilities for our production SAP deployments."

Contoso CIO and the company CFO, along with Business Development Manager (BDM), Director of SAP Business Analysts, and Director of SAP Operations are all open to taking advantage of Azure as a platform and want their respective teams to be able to leverage the scalability and resiliency provided by the cloud platform.

### Customer needs 

-   Reduce time to deploy new business processes to have competitive customer offers

-   Reduce time required to provision development and test environments

-   Lower costs incurred by the development, test, and production environments

-   Identify an estimated monthly infrastructure cost for operating your solution

### Technical requirements

-   SAP ERP/ECC 6.0 NetWeaver is the application tier

-   SQL Server 2014 is the data tier

-   Application tier on the production system requires total of 30,000 SAPS

-   Database tier on the production system requires total of 15,000 SAPS

-   Database tier on the production system needs 10,000 IOPS

-   The size of database files on the production system is 750GB, with the expected growth to 1TB

-   RPO=15 min, RTO=6 hours

-   Transaction log backups every 15 minutes, full daily backups retained for 1 month, monthly backups retained for 1 year

### Customer objections 

-   If I have already paid for my hardware to run my dev/test environment, how am I getting any cost savings by moving it to Azure? How much more is your cloud solution costing me?

-   What if I need my cloud resources to access on-premises resources?

-   Will Azure meet our security and compliance requirements?

-   Do I have to pay for resources when they are stopped?

-   Can I automate the shutdown at periodic times of day?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

>**Outcome**: Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 10-minute chalk-talk format.
>
>Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart. 

1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers? 
2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design** 
Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart.

***Architecting a multi-tier SAP solution***

Using the features of Azure and the requirements from the customer, design the application infrastructure and network for A Datum SAP deployment in Azure. Consider such factors as cost of ownership of entire SAP landscape as well as availability and disaster recovery capabilities for the production environment.
